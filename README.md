# British National Corpus Spoken Subset
The subset of the British National Corpus that is transcribed unscripted spoken dialogue, in plain text 

I don't claim to have any liscensing/ownership of this, I just made it myself from parsing the raw xml dump so if I'm not allowed to distribute this just let me know and I can take it down

corpus.txt is all of the unscripted spoken dialouge, where a \n represents a change of speaker

splitWordsCorpus.txt used [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8870261/how-to-split-text-without-spaces-into-list-of-words) to split apart some of the words in the corpus because the original text had a lot of wordsthatwerecombinedlikethis.
